                <p>There are many theories about the origins of football. Before FIFA's acceptance of kemari, it was generally accepted that the game originated in medieval England. In England around the 8th century, when a war was won, people celebrated their victory by cutting off the heads of enemy generals and kicking them to each other. This spread among the masses and became a 'game or festival' in which a sphere resembling the king's head was kicked and carried to a predetermined point.

                <p>A team athletic event, one of the ball games. Baseball (translation of Baseball) originated in the USA. The game is played mainly in the USA, Japan, Central America, East Asia and Australia, and in recent years the number of players in Europe and Africa has been increasing. First, the offensive batter hits the ball thrown by the defensive pitcher with the bat and scores a run when he rounds first, second, third and home bases in that order. The attack ends with three outs. The first and second attacking teams take it in turns to attack each other nine times, and the game is played to see how many runs they score.
                There are various theories as to the origins of the game, but the foundations of the current form were laid in the USA in 1845, and the game became one of the most popular sports in the country, with the first professional team being formed in 1869, making it a national pastime. It was introduced to Japan in 1872 (Meiji 5), and became a popular sport nationwide when university baseball became popular, and became popular and widespread among many sports.
                Worldwide, the spread of the sport is uneven and the number of players is not so large. Outside the USA and Japan, professional leagues have existed since the 1980s in Taiwan, South Korea and Australia, and it is one of the most popular sports. In Central American countries, Cuba, Dominica and Puerto Rico are known as strong countries. Although not so popular in Europe, amateur federations were founded in various countries in the second half of the 20th century, and the popularity of the sport has been growing since the end of the 20th century. In South Asia and Africa, the game is still in its infancy, but promotional activities by developed baseball nations are ongoing.
